            I'm currently living in <b>Hamden, Connecticut</b>, working as a React/TS web developer for <b>Travelers Insurance</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've spent 5 years as a developer at Travelers.
            I mainly develop in a React/TS stack with AWS hosted applications (both public and internal).
            Because of this, I'm often working with Terraform to configure and deploy our applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before this role, I also worked on the Travelers Application Security Team.
            I used OWASP Zap and AppScan to identify security vulnerabilities within Travelers web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I love traveling. My favorite so far has been my trip to Peru in 2024. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            When I'm at home, I can be found cooking, visiting breweries, or shaving strokes off my golf game ⛳.
